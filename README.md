## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Git and Curl (if not already installed)

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git curl

# Manjaro/Arch
sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm git curl
```

### 2. Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linux-setup.git ~/linux-setup
cd ~/linux-setup
```

> Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Run the Installation Script

```bash
cd scripts/../resources   # or wherever install.sh is located
bash install.sh
```

This will:

- Detect your shell (bash or zsh)
- Generate a `.profile` or `.zshrc` by merging dotfiles
- Ensure it's sourced in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

### 4. Apply the New Configuration

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```

## ðŸ”„ Cleanup Utilities

The setup includes functions you can use after installing:

```bash
cleanup             # Runs OS-specific cleanup (apt, pacman, etc.)
cleanupThumbnails   # Removes thumbnail cache from ~/.cache/thumbnails
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Structure (Optional)

You can recreate this structure from scratch using:

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh
```

This will create all necessary folders and files if missing.
